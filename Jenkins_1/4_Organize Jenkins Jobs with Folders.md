# Task

xFusionCorp Industries' DevOps team aims to streamline the management of Jenkins jobs by organizing them into distinct folders based on their purpose. Complete the task following the provided requirements:

1. Access the Jenkins UI by clicking on the `Jenkins` button in the top bar. Log in using the credentials: username `admin` and password `Adm!n321`.

2. Create a new folder named `Apache` within the Jenkins UI.

3. Move the existing jobs `httpd-php` and `services` under the newly created `Apache` folder.

## Notes :

1. Ensure to install any required plugins and restart the Jenkins service if necessary. Opt for Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on the plugin installation/update page.

2. Be aware that Jenkins UI may experience temporary unresponsiveness during the service restart. Refresh the UI page if needed.
