# Task

The Nautilus developers have requested the removal of a specific branch used for testing purposes. The branch named `xfusioncorp_apps` needs to be deleted from the Git repository located at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps` on the Storage server in Stratos DC.

# Steps and Solution

1. **SSH into the Storage Server:**

    If you haven't already, log into the Storage Server.

    ```bash
    ssh natasha@172.16.238.15
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Git Repository Directory:**

    Change directory to the location of the Git repository.

    ```bash
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
    ```

3. **Check Out a Different Branch:**

    Switch to a different branch to detach the worktree from `xfusioncorp_apps`. If there's another branch like `master`, check it out.

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    ```

4. **Delete the Branch Locally:**

    Now that the `xfusioncorp_apps` branch is no longer in use, you can delete it.

    ```bash
    git branch -D xfusioncorp_apps
    ```
